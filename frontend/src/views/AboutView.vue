        <h1>About here</h1>
        <p>
          This blog is all about the things I find interesting in the tech world, especially software and web related. 
          I'll be sharing my own insights and experiences, and I hope you'll find them just as fascinating as I do.
          Please note that this website is intended to evolve over time, with the addition of new functionalities and features in the near future.

        <h2 class="mt-4">Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a <b>French tech enthusiast</b> in my 30s, and I'm passionate about programming and cybersecurity. 
          From a young age, I've been fascinated by the possibilities that technology holds. 
          I've created websites and developed programs in C/C++ during my teenage years, fueling my love for all things tech.
          I pursued my education in computer science, earning a Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, and a <b>PhD in cybersecurity</b>.
          In my still short career, I've had the privilege of leading teams of up to 10 individuals in various tech domains like <b>web development, mobile development, microcontrollers, and DevOps</b>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">What to expect?</h2>
        <p>
          First of all, do not expect perfection: I learned a lot and will learn even more (and hopefully so will you!).
          I planned two types of content at the moment: articles and tutorials.
          Articles will contain facts and opinions regarding both existing and emerging technologies that have caught my attention at the time of writing.  
          These articles are meant to be concise and published regularly (say, a few per month).
          On the other hand, tutorials will provide step-by-step guidance on how to accomplish specific tasks (e.g. sending emails using NestJS). 
          They will be longer in length, ensuring that you have all the necessary information to implement it on your own.
          I hope you will find all of these interesting and valuable!
